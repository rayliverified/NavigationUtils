### Should I use Navigation Utils?

You should use NavigationUtils if the existing Navigation Libraries aren't working for you and you need full control.

- ❌ DON'T USE NavigationUtils if an existing navigation library works for you (GoRouter, RouteMaster, etc).
- ✅ USE NavigationUtils if you're thinking about implementing Navigator 2 directly or writing your own Navigation library.

Here's a helpful diagram for deciding whether NavigationUtils is the right fit for a project.

NavigationUtils does NOT add complexity. Instead, it embraces the intricacies of Navigator 2, providing a nuanced, comprehensive approach to implementing navigation.

A few compelling arguments for using Navigation Utils: 

- You're learning how to use Flutter's Navigator 2, not a third party library. The time you invest won't be wasted.
- You can implement complex navigation schemas without wrestling with the library.
- You can design navigation that seamlessly aligns with your app and architecture, rather than allowing navigation to dictate architectural choices.

As you incorporate more advanced navigation features, like deeplinks, authentication, and URLs, you'll likely encounter growing challenges and limitations that can drive up costs. There comes a point when direct, hands-on experience with Navigator 2 becomes crucial.

If navigation hurdles have become a constant in your development process, it's time to bite the bullet and master Navigator 2. The learning curve is steep, but the alternative is a seemingly endless cycle of issues, roadblocks, and limitations.
